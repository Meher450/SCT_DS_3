# ðŸ’¼ Term Deposit Prediction using Decision Tree

In this project, I built a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their banking details. This project includes data preprocessing, training/testing, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Features
- Label encoding of categorical variables
- Decision Tree model training with entropy criterion
- Stratified train-test split
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Feature importance plot

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Replace the dataset path with your local `.csv` file
2. Run the script:

```bash
python SCT_DS_3.py
